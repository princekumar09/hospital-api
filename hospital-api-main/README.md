# Discription
Doctor Registration:

Endpoint: /doctors/register
Method: POST
Description: This endpoint allows doctors to register themselves in the hospital system. Doctors need to provide their basic information such as name, email, password, specialty, and contact details. Upon successful registration, a unique doctor ID is generated, which will be used for further interactions.
Doctor Login:

Endpoint: /doctors/login
Method: POST
Description: This endpoint enables doctors to log in to the hospital system using their registered credentials (email and password). Upon successful login, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated and returned in the response. This token will be used to authenticate the doctor for subsequent API calls.
Patient Registration:

Endpoint: /patients/register
Method: POST
Description: This endpoint allows patients to register themselves in the hospital system. Patients need to provide their basic information, such as name, date of birth, gender, address, and contact details. Additionally, they may need to answer some health-related questions, including recent travel history, symptoms, etc.
Patient Reports Regarding COVID-19:

Endpoint: /patients/all_reports

Method: GET

Additional considerations:

Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented to ensure that only registered doctors can access patient reports.
The API should be secured using HTTPS to protect sensitive data transmitted over the network.
Data validation and error handling should be implemented to ensure the integrity and reliability of the API.
The hospital API may have other features like scheduling appointments, viewing patient medical history, prescription management, etc., which can be added as per the requirements.
Please note that this is a high-level overview, and in practice, the API would require more detailed design and implementation to ensure security, efficiency, and ease of use.
